	<h3>Involvement in research</h3>

	<h5>ML_ESM_DIFF (<a href="https://github.com/hutchresearch/ml_climate_diff.git">Link</a>)</h5>
	<p>Emulating Earth System Models (ESMs) using diffusion models and generating joint-variable 
		samples including precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity. We are also training

	<h3>Independent Projects (all unfinished)</h3>
	<p>These projects are things I've tried to do in my spare time. 
		Many of them are unfinished because they are strictly personal projects, therefore lower priority compared to class projects. 
		Even if unfinished, I still usually learned about useful packages and tools I otherwise wouldn't be exposed to. </p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href = "https://github.com/Ndearing4/Wakevoice">Music Player</a>: This project involved creating a window that plays music from mp4 files in a nearby directory. I was looking for something that 
			could organize my music into categories based on what I wanted to listen to. 
			This was my first real adventure with using a package I didn't completely understand in JPanel, making this a good exercise in learning and using
			preexisting packages. I also got to practice good object oriented design, something I'd recently learned about in class.</li>
		<li><a>Clustering for Airplane Flights</a> This project was a continuation on a final project I was not satisfied with for my Into to Data Science class at Western.

		<li>Spotify playlist</li>
